# Animath

## Inspiration
As Whitney Houston famously said, “The children are our future, teach them well and let them lead the way”. In doing so, we decided to create a webpage that specializes in teaching children math topics (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) in a fun, interactive way that will boost productivity and give more of an incentive to complete more questions. 

## What it does
Ultimately, the goal of animath is to assist students learning math concepts to strengthen their understanding while providing eye-catching gifs and productive music. We tried to simplify the web page as much as possible because if the user is a child, they will likely not understand a cluttered screen. TO hone in on the fact that there's specific buttons for the child to press, directions are written in lower level english to assist in finding where to start. When the student engages in one of the 4 math topics, they are presented a set of questions pertaining to that topic and there is feedback given if the student answers it correctly or not. 

## How we built it
HTML (structured and presented information / elements)
CSS (enhanced the layout / appearance of the elements)
Javascript (allows for interactive / dynamic pages)

## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges that we faced during our hack was the implementation of Api’s and backend storing for user profile. Due to the time constraint and inexperience of our members, we were not able to incorporate this in time. In addition, during the hack, we also ran into some time-eating errors of background music and padding for our gifs but in the end collaboration powered through. 

## Accomplishments 
As a team we are incredibly proud of our collaboration and productivity to create a functioning, visually appealing educational game that people in their childhood can learn, yet have fun doing so. The implementation of the gifs, background music and the button effects were also worth noting as this had been our first time utilizing any of the three languages, stemming from our use of p5. 

## What's next for Animath
The future of animath would be a more intricate design of our visually attractive site already, with an implementation of backend databases in which we can store progress bars and create harder questions based on the user’s completed questions. We can also incorporate api’s that give the user feedback such as openai and a question bank. Currently our program is still quite beginner as for children, a simple program can keep them from being confused by the directions and page design.
